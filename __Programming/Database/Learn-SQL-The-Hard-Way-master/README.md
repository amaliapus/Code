Learn-SQL-The-Hard-Way
======================

Need to review some SQL, this book (in progress) seems like a good way to do it. The author uses a sqlite3 
database. I'm going to use MySQL to solve the problems instead. 

Each problem is organized into one folder consisting of the necessary .sql files.
